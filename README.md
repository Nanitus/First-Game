Block Blaster - AI

Block Blaster is a small project that I wanted to integrate an AI that would calculate the player's location and shoot at the player,
I was interested in seeing how I could change an object's AI in Unity to determine how it would figure out a player's location. This
game is fairly similar to bullet hell games.
